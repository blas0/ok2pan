## Project Analysis Summary

**Detected Configuration:**
- **Project Name**: ok2pan
- **Repository**: https://github.com/blas0/ok2pan
- **Tech Stack**: React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Languages**: JavaScript (primary), JSX, JSON, HTML, CSS
- **Key Frameworks**:
  - React 19 (UI library)
  - HeroUI (component library)
  - Framer Motion (animations)
  - React Router (routing)
  - Culori (color manipulation)
  - @atesgoral/acb (ACB file generation)

**Architecture Patterns:**
- Single Page Application (SPA)
- Component-based React architecture
- Static JSON data source (colors.json with 242KB of Pantone colors)
- Client-side color manipulation
- ACB (Adobe Color Book) file generation with LAB color space conversion

**Key Files:**
- `pantone-app/src/App.jsx` - Main application component
- `pantone-app/generate-acb.js` - ACB file generation script
- `pantone-app/colors.json` - Pantone color database
- `pantone-app/src/components/` - React components
- `pantone-app/src/utils/` - Utility functions

**Special Features:**
- LAB color space conversion for accurate color representation
- Adobe Color Book (.acb) file generation
- Pantone color search and browsing
- Animated UI with Anime.js and Framer Motion

## Questions / Decisions Pending
- [ ] Should we initialize Cognee knowledge graph for this project?
- [ ] What are the primary development goals for upcoming sessions?
- [ ] Are there specific features or improvements planned?

## Next Session Focus
Priority order for next conversation:
1. Complete initialization (Cognee setup if desired, git commit)
2. Review existing codebase and understand current implementation
3. Identify any issues or areas for improvement
4. Plan next development tasks based on project goals
